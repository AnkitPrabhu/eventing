Steps to build Couchbase server with eventing -

$ repo init -u git://github.com/couchbase/manifest.git -m toy/toy-eventing.xml
$ repo sync --jobs=20
$ make -j8

Make sure that the number of open files for a process is atleast 5000.
It can be set by -
$ ulimit -n 5000
For convenience, add the above command to .bash_profile.

Start the server and setup the cluster –
$ cd ns_server
$ ./cluster_run –n1
$ ./cluster_connect –n1

Set Memory-Optimized Global Secondary Indexes -
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:9102/settings -u Administrator:asdasd -d '{"indexer.settings.storage_mode": "memory_optimized"}'

Add 'eventing' user as admin -
$ curl -u Administrator:asdasd -v -XPUT -d "password=asdasd&roles=admin" http://localhost:9000/settings/rbac/users/local/eventing

Add the `beer-sample` bucket from Settings > Sample buckets.
Under the Query tab execute –
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `beer-sample`;

Now you can goto Eventing and create and deploy apps.
Please remember to add user in the application settings for each app that you create.

Logs -
From ns_server directory,
$ tail -f logs/n_0/eventing.log


Sample application
Let us consider the example -
We want to monitor the beer-sample bucket for those beers whose abv > 20 and add those into another bucket called "abv_bucket".

Please do the following before proceeding with this example –
1) Create a bucket abv_bucket.
2) Under the Query tab and execute – CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON abv_bucket;

Under 'Eventing' tab, create a new application.

Handler:
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    var bucket = '`beer-sample`';
    var abvLim = 20;

    // Select all the beers whose abv value > 20.
    var res =   SELECT name, abv
                FROM :bucket
                WHERE abv > :abvLim;

    for(var row of res) {
        var name = row.name;
        var data = JSON.stringify(row);

        // Upsert these rows into abv_bucket.
        var ins = UPSERT INTO abv_bucket (KEY, VALUE) VALUES (':name', :data);
        ins.execQuery();
    }
}

function OnDelete(msg){
}

Deployment plan:
{
"buckets": [
  {
   "alias": "abv_bucket",
   "bucket_name": "abv_bucket"
  }
],
"metadata_bucket": "eventing",
"source_bucket": "beer-sample"
}

Settings:
Please make sure that you’ve added user “eventing” with password “asdasd”.
Set the log level to “Trace” incase you want to see the log messages in eventing.log.
